Basal (and internal, if any) melting/freezing is included
in the other curve, which is "dhb" in the file (and is non-zero...?).

Hi Eli and Dorian,

Luckily, a grad student of Jim Kasting here has begun to use my 2005 code, 
and we recently repeated the 4 runs in that paper. So it's easy for me to 
send you the data.

However, the data file format is quite grungy. It's attached, for Fig. 4 
dotted lines (i.e., with sea glaciers, bubbly ice, omega_0 = 0.999). 
The file is ascii. Each variable has a header line followed by a data line,
with data values running from 89N, 87N, ... to 89S.
All variables for a given time slice are printed together, with a time slice
every 1000 years. I've extracted just the last time slice, for year 400000. 
The model has essentially equilibrated by then.

Find the header "pme(mm/a) :" 
The next line are P-E values, Fig. 4c dashed,  89N to 89S (hemis. symmetric).
About 30 lines below, find  "dhb(mm/a) :".
The next line should be the dashed line in Fig. 4d (basal/interior melt/freeze).

Any questions welcome. As you may know, I'll be at the PALSEA workshop 
this Thursday to Saturday - so we can perhaps chat then.

I thought about extending the sea glacier model to 2-D, several years ago.
For 1-D, or Cartesian or Polar Stereographic grids, the dynamical ice-shelf 
equations for u and v are straightforward, i.e., the MacAyeal/Morland SSA 
vertically averaged flow equations. But re-formulating those equations 
and their derivation to Spherical Polars, as neeed for a 2-D global or 
hemispheric spherical domain, was very non-trivial for me (involving tensors). 
Even though in principle it just requires coordinate transformations, 
I never quite got a final set of equations I was happy with! 
Shawn Marshall, in an appendix of his PhD thesis, claims to have done it, 
but I think his derivation and equations are incorrect (they don't satisy 
basic kinematic constraints). We talked about it at the time, and Shawn 
agreed it could be wrong. 

I don't know if you're looking at cartesian or spherical coords - if the 
latter, I'd be interested in your approach.

David.
